These are the settings of this game.
There are four types of input lines you get in your standard input from the engine:
<ul><li>"Settings": game settings such as game type and maximum timebank balance.</li>
<li>"Match": game information such as cards and pot size.</li>
<li>"go 2341": this means you need to output your move in 2341 milliseconds.</li>
<li>"botX call YY": player actions, you will receive the actions from your opponents, but also your own.</li></ul>

<p>
Start of the hand info.
Most of this will make sense if you know how to play poker.
The player on the button will be playing the small blind, hence acting first preflop, but last on the flop and later.
Compare it to the "Settings yourBot" command to find out if it's you on the button.

<p>
The ``go'' means that you need to make a move within 5 seconds.
Whenever it's your turn you will first receive updated stack and pot size information.
Note that the uncalled bet is placed in the first sidepot.
</p>

<pre class='stdout'>raise 20</pre>
<p>Let's minraise, just print this to standard output.</p>

<pre>bot2 raise 20
bot3 raise 40 </pre>
<p>
You receive your own action back, plus any actions from opponents.
Note that the "bot2 raise 20" means that the bot will put an additional <b>30 chips</b> in, since there was an uncalled bet of 10 (big blind minus small blind).
</p>

<p>
Since it's again our turn, we receive updated stack and pot size information.
Note that we put 40 chips in the pot, since we raised 20 on top of the big blind of 20, leaving us 1460 in our stack.
Our opponent has raised an additional 40 on top, hence he has only 1420 chips left.
</p>

<pre class='stdout'>fold 0</pre>
<p>We don't have much of a hand here, let it go.</p>

<pre>bot2 fold 0

We give up, and so the hand is over.
Our opponent gets the pot (80) and gets his bet (40) back.

<pre class='stdout'>raise 40</pre>
<p>
We've made a pair. Let's bet.
In order to bet, we send a "raise" command to standard output.
(Note that there is no "bet" command. Just "fold", "check", "call", and "raise".)

Note that for calling, checking and folding, the engine still expects you to respond with an amount.
This makes parsing easier, but the actual amount you put in is irrelevant.

What a donkey!
How can he stack off with THAT?!?
</p>

<pre class='stdout'>raise 1210</pre>
<p>
The engine will adjust your amount if you raise more than you have.
Note that, while our stack was 1210, there was still 120 to call.
The command "raise 1210" implies putting 1330 more chips in the pot.
Hence the raise is truncated to 1090 chips.
