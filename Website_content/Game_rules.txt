Game rules

Game type:
The bots play no-limit texas holdem with the usual poker rules. Bots play matches against each other in heads up mode, so each match is a battle between two bots. In each match, two bots play against each other until one of the two bots has all the chips. So matches have the form of little tournaments.

Stacks & blind levels:
Bots start each match with a stack of 1500 chips. The blinds start at 10/20. During a match the blinds will be increased each time after a fixed number of hands. A match will continue until one bot has won all the chips. The increasing blinds make sure that each match will not take too long. Next to this the increasing blinds give dynamic matches that are more challenging for the bots.

Bot reaction times:
When playing a match, the involved bots receive general information of the match. The bots are then given some time to initialize and prepare for playing. Each bot has a time bank, which is set at the start of a new match. The time bank keeps track of the amount of time your bot has left to make moves. The time your bot needs for choosing its moves is deducted from the time bank, but a small amount of time is added to the time bank for each move that your bot has to make. So on average your bot should be able to choose an action within a given small amount of time, but the time bank gives the opportunity to think a little longer in difficult situations. The time per move and the starting time bank are sent to the bot at the start of a match, and for each move a bot has to make it receives the amount of time that is left in its time bank.
